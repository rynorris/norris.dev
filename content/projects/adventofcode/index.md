description: my solutions for the yearly programming challenge
---

Overview
--------

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly programming challenge taking place throughout December each year.

One puzzle is released each day, with difficulty generally ramping up throughout the month.

While there is a competition element, many people (including myself) treat this as an opportunity
to learn something new, try a new programming language etc.

2019
--------

For 2019 I decided to solve the problems using [elm](https://elm-lang.org).

The solutions are built into an interactive web page.
