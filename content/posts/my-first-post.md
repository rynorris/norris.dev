So I saw this morning that google had just released the .dev TLD to the public so I decided it was time to generate myself a personal site, and immediately bought "norris.dev".

Previously I've done most of my webdev with SPAs in React (which I love working with!).  So I decided this time to try something different, and generate a static site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Since I already have some hosts running in EC2, I thought it would be easiest to keep all my bills in one place, and hosted using [AWS Amplify](https://aws-amplify.github.io/), which turned out to be remarkably simple.

A couple of hours later, and I have a fully-functional personal website!  What a world!

Now I just have to write some content!
